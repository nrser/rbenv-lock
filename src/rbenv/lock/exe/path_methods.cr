# `Rbenv::Lock::Exe` Path Methods
# ============================================================================
# 
# The `//src/rbenv/lock/exe.cr` file got a bit big and unwieldy by my standards,
# so I started to split it up. It is `require`d in the main `Exe` file and
# should **NOT** be loaded independently.
# 
# This file contains methods for obtaining the correct paths to the various
# files and directories needed to properly construct the environments and 
# execute the commends necessary.
