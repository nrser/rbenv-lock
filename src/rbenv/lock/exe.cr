# Runtime representation of a lock executable. Includes methods to write 
# lock files, read them back in, and `exec` in their environment.
# 
# Lock executables live in {.dir}, and are simply executable YAML files whose
# "shebang" lines point to `//bin/rbenv-lock-exec-file`. Hence the executables
# serve as the database as well, each containing all the data for a particular
# lock.
